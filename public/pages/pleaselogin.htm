                <h2>Pre-Rendered Dialog</h2>
                <p>
                This is a pre-rendered dialog, which means that <code>$mdDialog</code> doesn't compile its
                template on each opening.
                <br/><br/>
                The Dialog Element is a static element in the DOM, which is just visually hidden.<br/>
                Once the dialog opens, we just fetch the element from the DOM into our dialog and upon close
                we restore the element back into its old DOM position.
                </p>
            </md-dialog>
